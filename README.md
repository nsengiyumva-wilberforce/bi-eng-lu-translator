# BIO-MEDICAL ENGLISH-LUGANDA TRANSLATION MODEL

This project introduces an innovative English-Luganda translation model tailored for the bio-medical domain. Developed by the Makerere University AI Research Lab, this model leverages a state-of-the-art transformer architecture with an attention mechanism to facilitate accurate and contextually relevant translations. This initiative aims to bridge the communication gap in healthcare, ensuring vital medical information is accessible to Luganda speakers. We seek funding to expand this crucial work and extend its benefits to other low-resource languages in Uganda.

## FUTURE PLANS

The future plan is to extend this model to other low-resource Ugandan languages. Uganda has a rich linguistic landscape, with several native languages including:

*   Luganda
*   Runyoro
*   Runyankole
*   Ateso
*   Luo
*   Lugbara
*   Gisu
*   Rufumbira
*   Rukiiga

Our plan for extending the model includes:

*   **Rufumbira**: We plan to visit radio stations in Kisoro to collect health-related news (both old and new) for training data.
*   **Rukiiga**: We intend to visit radio stations in Kabale, Kanungu, and Rukungiri to gather health-related news for training data.
